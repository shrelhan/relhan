        <h2>The Relhan Legacy: From Dhaba to top Quality Sweets</h2>
        <p class="lead mt-3">
          <b>The Foundation (1960s)</b>
          In the early 1960s, our journey began with Gurbaksh Lal Ji and the
          iconic Relhan Dhaba. Known affectionately by the community as
          <em>"Gurdayal Ji Hotal Wale"</em>
          the dhaba became a staple of honest, soul-satisfying food. For two
          decades, it served as a gathering place where quality was never
          compromised and every guest was treated like family.
        </p>
        <p class="lead mt-3">
          <b>The Evolution (The Sweet Resolution)</b>
          With twenty years of success in the restaurant world, Gurbaksh Lal Ji
          pivoted to a new craft, founding Relhan Sweets Corner. He did so with
          a singular, unwavering resolution: to create sweets using only the
          finest raw materials. He believed that purity wasn't just a goal, it
          was a responsibility to the people who trusted the Relhan name. We
          still source the branded ingredients, just as Gurbaksh Lal Ji did in
          the 60s. But now, we are pairing that old-world integrity with a
          new-world vision, ensuring that the Relhan Sweets legacy continues to
          thrive in a modern era. <br />
          <b><em>"Same Purity. New Generation. Since 1960."</em></b>
